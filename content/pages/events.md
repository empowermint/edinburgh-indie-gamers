## Open Saturdays

On the second and fourth Saturday of each month, we play games! No prior experience or preparation needed. Anyone can pitch a single-session game, either in advance or on the night, or just turn up and play.

In person sessions start from 18:30 in [Kilderkin, 6 Canongate, EH8 8BT](https://kilderkingroup.co.uk/kilderkin-2/). Online sessions muster from 19:00 on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/6vNbsq5tSV). In both cases, we spend half an hour to pick which game(s) we want to play, and aim to end around 22:00. All Open Saturday events follow our [Code of Conduct](https://edinburgh-indie-gamers.netlify.app/code-of-conduct), and use safety tools (such as the X-Card). 

For the foreseeable future, Open Saturday will be online on the second Saturday, and in-person on the fourth Saturday. In August, both sessions will be online due to the Festival. The fourth Saturday in December does not have an Open Saturday due to the holiday season. 

Any updates and changes to our regular scheduling will appear on our [News Feed](https://edinburgh-indie-gamers.netlify.app/news).
