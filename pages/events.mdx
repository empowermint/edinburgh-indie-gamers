# Events

## Open Saturdays

Twice per month, we come together to play indie & small press tabletop RPGs and story games! No prior experience or preparation is needed. Anyone can pitch a single-session game they would like to facilitate, either in advance or on the night. Otherwise, just turn up and play!

* Online sessions take place on the second Saturday of each month and muster from 19:00 on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/6vNbsq5tSV).
* In-person sessions take place on the fourth Saturday of each month and start from 18:30 in [Kilderkin, 6 Canongate, EH8 8BT](https://kilderkingroup.co.uk/kilderkin-2/).

In both cases, we spend the first half hour chatting, discuss the pitched games, and decide which of them we want to play. Games aim to end around 22:00. 

All attendees must follow our [Code of Conduct](https://edinburgh-indie-gamers.netlify.app/code-of-conduct). If there are any issues that need to be raised, please contact a member of our club Admin Team on the Discord Server linked above. 

Please note that in August, both sessions will be online due to the Festival. Also, the fourth Saturday in December does not have an Open Saturday due to the holiday season.
