    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>Edinburgh Indie Gamers is an inclusive gaming club dedicated to indie roleplaying and story games.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What is a indie game?</h2>
    <p>We play small-press roleplaying games, narrative games, Nordic-style games, diceless games, GMful and GMless games, PbTA games... The types of games which let players tell a story together.</p>
    <p>If you're not sure what any of this means, that's a sign you need to get stuck in and join us. (The water's lovely...)</p>

    <h2>Fun for Everyone</h2>
    <p>We want our group to be a welcoming and safe community. That's why we have <a href="/code-of-conduct">a code of conduct</a> which we ask you to read and uphold while taking part in our spaces, online and in person.</p>

    <h2>Join the Discord</h2>
    <p>You can <a href="https://discord.gg/6vNbsq5tSV">join our Discord server</a> to chat with members and co-ordinate online games. Generally, members should be from Edinburgh, Scotland and its nearby regions, but we're also open to folks who are geographically remote or otherwise isolated.</p>

    <h2>Awesome Zine</h2>
    <p>In 2021 we crowdfunded a zine to share games, art and articles by our community with the wider world. One of the things the zine funded was a website for our club. This is that website!</p>
    <p>We would love for you to read, print, enjoy, translate and generally consume our zine. You can <a href="https://empowermint.itch.io/edinburgh-indie-gamers-zine-2021">download it for free on itch.io</a></p>
