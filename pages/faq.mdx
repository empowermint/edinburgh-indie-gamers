# FAQ

## Club

### What does 'Indie' mean?

It's a bit of a woolly word... and we often joke about the fact it doesn't really mean anything.

What we mean by it that this is a club focused on games that aren't commercially dominant - i.e. not D&D, GURPS, Warhammer, or Vampire the Masquerade. There are other clubs in Edinburgh that play these types of games and do so very well. This one is for the other stuff!

### Do you ever play D&D?

D&D is a good game, but it's not what we are about. Do not worry if you've never played anything else. We choose games that are varied and simple to play. Members will be happy to help you get comfortable and enjoy playing.

## Events

### What is the general format of your events?

Our events begin with a half-hour arrival period in which people can find each other and get settled in.

Then at the start time, those volunteering to facilitate games will make a short pitch for what they're planning to run. Members divide into groups to play the different games on offer (newcomers get first pick) and then the games begin!

We usually play for three hours, but sometimes the games run over or finish early.

Afterwards, people like to gather to discuss their experiences and find out what happened in the other games.

### Are events free?

Yes. It is not necessary to purchase anything from the venue (though it's nice if you can) and we do not have a culture of tipping GMs.

### Do I have to run a game?

No. Most people don't, so you will not feel left out!

### But can I run a game?

Yes. If you agree to follow the <Link href="./code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</Link> (i.e. to use safety tools at your table) then you are welcome and encouraged to run a game. There is no application or approval process - you can just do it.

If you would like support in running a game, you can ask in the server and members will help you out.

### Would you like to playtest my game?

While we do sometimes run playtest games at our events, these are usually designed by our regulars. If you pitch a playtest of your own game without building relationship with people first, it is unlikely that anyone will be interested in playing it.

## Discord

### Do I have to be local to Edinburgh to join your Discord?

We restrict membership of our Discord server because we really value our community and want it to grow organically and sustainably.

The Discord is open to adults:

- who plan to come to our in-person events in Edinburgh
- who are alumni now living further afield
- who are want to attend our online events due to being housebound or living very remotely, and who are happy to operate in the UK timezone (If you are part of this group, please don't feel like you have to explain or justify yourself)

If you live in a populous area that does not have a local gaming club, we think you should start one! Please help yourself to free copies of our zines, which contain advice for starting your own groups.

### How can I tell you about my gaming products, events or business?

We respectfully ask you not to, with no exceptions. EIG is not a suitable venue for marketing your stuff.
