# Code of Conduct

Edinburgh Indie Gamers (EIG) is a gaming community. Everyone participating in Edinburgh Indie Gamers including, but not limited to our Discord Server, social media, and face to face gaming events, is required to agree to this Code of Conduct.

EIG is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neurotype, physical appearance, body, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, language, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

Participating in EIG constitutes acknowledgement and acceptance to abide by this Code of Conduct in both digital and physical spaces.

Anyone who violates this Code of Conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from EIG spaces.

## Principles

In accordance with our Code of Conduct, everyone who participates in Edinburgh Indie Gamers shall function within the following principles:

### Safety

All games run within our community must use, explain, and support safety tools. This isn't to eliminate challenging content, but to make sure that everyone knows the bounds and has given consent.

### Consideration

That safety doesn't end at the gaming table, or with formal safety tools. We ask when in our spaces you consider your words and their impact. It is vital that members can offer opinions and discuss issues, but that should be done in a spirit of support, kindness, and inclusivity. Think about your intent and act in those spaces with integrity and love. Be positive and supportive of others as you would hope they would be of you.

### Inclusivity

Community members must be supportive and inclusive. They should think about the impact of their words, the privilege they hold, and the relative position of those they interact with. As a community we prioritise marginalised people’s safety above privileged people’s comfort and will make all reasonable efforts to be inclusive.
Play Guidelines

## Guidelines

In the course of exemplifying the Community Principles, all members of our community shall function within the following guidelines:

- Respect player pronouns and character pronouns; routinely reaffirm these throughout play and at the start of each session
- Practice regular check-ins for enthusiastic consent of game content
- Respect player autonomy and practice regular check-ins to affirm enthusiastic agreement of game development
- Clearly declare the concept, aim, tone, & subject matter (including clear content warnings) of every game played through Edinburgh Indie Gamers.
- Explain and incorporate some form of tools for safe play (e.g. X-Card, Lines & Veils, etc) into every game shared

## Tools

Games organized through the Edinburgh Indie Gamers must use tools for safe, welcoming play. We recommend that all members read [the TTRPG Safety Toolkit curated by Kienna Shaw and Lauren Bryant-Monk.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/114jRmhzBpdqkAlhmveis0nmW73qkAZCj "Gaming safety resource")

We also strongly recommend that community members read [Accessibility in Tabletop curated by Jennifer Kretchmer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZFSXz-Yva1KZAsP7NblCdkoiQ6RcjxSV2gj98eXusJs/edit "Gaming accessibility resource").

Such bad faith actions include, but are not limited to:

- Complaints of ‘reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’
- Complaints against the reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”
- Complaints of someone communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial
- Complaints against criticisms of racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behaviour or assumptions

## Reporting

If you experience disrespectful or harassing behaviour by a member of the community, notice that someone else is being disrespected or harassed, or have any other concerns, please immediately contact one of the Admin Team on our club [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/6vNbsq5tSV).

### Enforcement and Consequences

Participants asked to modify their behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

Any and all complaints received by the admin team are investigated and steps are taken to minimise harm to participants. If requested, we will endeavour to protect the confidentiality of a complainant to the fullest extent possible.

If the person who is harassing you is a member of the Admin Team, either officially or in an ancillary capacity, they will not be involved in handling the incident.

You should be assured that there will be no retaliation against you for making good faith claims.
