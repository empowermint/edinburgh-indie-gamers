## Story Game Hangout

Our regular recurring event is Story Game Hangout, where we come together to play indie & small press tabletop RPGs and story games.

Sessions take place on the fourth Saturday of most months and start from 18:30 at the [Kilderkin, 6 Canongate, EH8 8BT](https://kilderkingroup.co.uk/kilderkin-2/). 

At 19:00, we pitch games, divide into tables, and start playing. Games aim to end around 22:00. 

No prior experience or preparation is needed. Anyone can pitch a single-session game they would like to facilitate, either in advance or on the night. Otherwise, just turn up and play!

Games begin and end in a single session, so there is no long-term commitment - and we get the chance to play lots and lots of different games.

All attendees must follow our [Code of Conduct](https://edinburgh-indie-gamers.netlify.app/code-of-conduct). If there are any issues, please raise them with member of our club Admin Team.

You do not need to be a member of the Discord group to attend.

Please note that we do not meet in person in August or December due to the respective holiday seasons.

## Ad-hoc Events

Members also use EIG as a platform to organise other roleplaying events and social activities both on- and off- line. In the past, we've had game-makers meetups, book clubs, longer-running games, game jams, movie trips, experimental rotating GM nights, and the odd barbecue - to name just a few.
